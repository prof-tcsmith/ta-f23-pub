# PA02

Find a Web API (not one that was demonstrated in class). See the references in the notebook for good sites to get a list of web API's.

NOTE: You are not to use an 'API wrapper' - you are to use POST or GET HTTP requests to work directly with the API.

Write a notebook that demonstrates the use of this API for corpus development. In the notebook, provide a title, an introduction to the web API, and what you will use the API for in your demonstration. Then, provide a demonstration of the API usage. Add a section at the end of your notebook called summary. In the summary section, discuss this API's possible use for data mining and analytics projects.
NOTE: Late assignments will not be accepted, so be sure to give yourself plenty of time so that you can deal with any possible last-minute issues such as computer trouble and network trouble.
