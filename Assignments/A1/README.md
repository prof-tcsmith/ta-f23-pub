Use screen scraping to collect the speeches of all US Presidents, available from the Miller Center's website (https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches

Links to an external site.). Add to the corpus the year of each speech, each presidentâ€™s party affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Other), and the start and end dates of the president's term (find a website with this information, and use screen scraping to extract the relevant information). Place all fields (including the speech content, party affiliation, and start and end dates) in a CSV file. 

Analyze the content of your csv file to answer the following questions.

1. Which president has the most and least vocabulary, as evident from their inaugural speeches? On average, do Democratic, Republican, or Other presidents have a higher vocabulary? (2 points)

> NOTE: For the remianing questions, use all speeches (not just he inaugural speeches)

2. Create a barplot of presidential vocabularies from the earliest president (Washington) to the latest (Biden) in chronological order **using all speeches** from each president. Color code this barplot as blue for Democrat, red for Republican, and gray for Others. (1 point)

3. What are the five most frequently used words (exclusive of stop words) used by each president? What are the five most frequently words used collectively by all Democratic presidents versus Republican presidents? (2 point)

4. What are the key themes (e.g., freedom, liberty, country, etc.) used by each president in their inaugural speech? (3 points)

5. Compute a sentiment (positive/negative) for each presidential speech, and draw a barplot of the sentiment of all presidential speeches in chronological order. Again, color code the speeches as blue for Democrat, red for Republican, and gray for Other. Which of these groups have higher mean sentiment score? Who are the top three presidents with the highest positive sentiment in each group? (2 points)

NOTE2: Points will be deducted for copy-and-paste code from the class examples without thinking about their appropriateness for the assignment. Your code must be compact, free of errors, without unnecessary details not asked in the question, using functions and loops as appropriate, and using some comment statements. You will lose points if you fail to adhere to these common coding expectations.
